So this is project Eartha, where we will first create a website, like I explained in the discord channel in the #about page. https://discord.gg/xMFufBSuCC

Since github only allows static content to be hosted on https://lovevice.github.io/Eartha/ I will still upload the php files which will be used for mysql database, but you will have to test it by yourself by hosting it yourself on apache.
